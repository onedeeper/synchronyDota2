The relationship between movement synchrony and task performance has been studied in various experimental settings, in both physical and virtual tasks. However, there is a lack of investigation in the utility of synchrony as potential target of performance evaluation in high stakes competitive settings, physical or virtual. This study explores the application of cluster phase methods, typically used in the physical domain, to investigate within-team movement synchrony in Esports, specifically Dota 2 (D2), a 5-versus-5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA). We collected and analysed movement data of in-game avatars from two professional D2 tournaments, testing whether team synchrony was significantly different from chance, if it changed over the course of matches, and whether overall synchrony predicted performance. Findings revealed movement synchrony above chance level, and a negative association between overall synchrony and performance. However, synchrony did not show a discernible trend over the course of matches. We discuss these findings, outline limitations of the study and highlight future research directions.
